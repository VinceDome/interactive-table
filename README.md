# About the project
This is the full source code for my yearly project at my high school, AKG.
## Method
A projector and a camera are suspended above a table, using a piece of wood and 3d printed attachment parts. The camera processes the objects it sees on the table (using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)), and with precise alignment, the projector can correctly project the outlines of small, 3d printed markers. This creates a system, where the apps can be operated by the markers.

### Currently there are two demo apps:
  - A game where the players guess the location of major cities in Hungary on a blank map
  - A game where the players place the hands on an analog clock to match the time displayed digitally
## About the developement
- All of the code is written by Bartha Vince DÃ¶me, a high-school student studying in the high school AKG.
- I got additional help with designing the structure that holds up the projector 1.5 meters above the table.
- This project got second place on the hungarian competition, [MiniMaker](https://fb.me/e/4cgvXt9h6) (hosted by [Fablab](https://www.fablabbudapest.com/)).
